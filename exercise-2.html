                <h2>Who is Yuma?</h2>
                <blockquote>Born in Osaka,
                    Yuma Sumi is a former <strong>professional ballet dancer</strong> at
                    <a href="http://www.opera.ge">State Ballet of Georgia</a> in Tbilisi, Georgia.</blockquote>
                <p class="star">* * *</p>
                <p>As a ballet dancer, I trained in Japan, Portugal and Netherlands, and performed internationally such as at
                    Bolshoi theater in Moscow. My journey as a freelancer in Japan began this March, as I gave my last performance with SBG in Israel. On graduating from Code Chrysalis Foundations Course this summer, I
                    moved to Itoshima, Fukuoka, to learn sustainable living skills and identify local and social issues.</p>

                <h3>What brought him to CC7?</h3>
                <blockquote>Yuma is focusing on what he would call
                    <strong>
                        <em>the collaboration of art and business</em>
                    </strong>.</blockquote>
                <p class="star">* * *</p>
                <p>Back in my days in Tbilisi, I had a knee injury that forced me to stop dancing for a while, and to come back
                    to Japan all the way just to see good doctors, who actually could not give me any useful advices. It
                    was simply annoying that I could not find anyone who could possibily help me out, until I bump into the
                    one - only possbily. That was the first time the idea to become a software engineer to support those
                    suffering, without getting bothered with restriction by location, came into my mind.</p>

                    unique concept of this house, "sustainable lifestyle of food, job and energy," all of them grow rice
                    together so they do not have to buy one for a year at all (which is just one of the good examples of
                    their attempts.) </p>
